## Hey There!

You probably run a pretty busy schedule, so here's a casual reminder that you've signed up for the EngineRoom meetup which is happening **this Wednesday (8th May 2019), 7pm at [1 Fusionopolis View, #08-01 Sandcrawler, 138577](https://goo.gl/maps/RDcUoUmsmY6He63P6) (Opposite One North MRT)**

Also, below are the event details for a recap, along with some important notes on entry to the building.

### Important Notes

- Please arrive by about 7pm (7.15pm max) as security is tight at this office and we need to bring people up in batches, the second entry timing will be after the Open Space at 8+ because we might be pretty shorthanded on manpower
- The building security will have a namelist of all attendees. On arriving, please verify your name with them and provide your contact details prior to us bringing you up
