# About Us

EngineRoom is a product-centric software engineering community created by engineers for engineers.

Our aim is to be a community that brings together proficient product/service creators to discuss experiences, learn from the '*been theres*, and share on individual journeys.

## Principles

### Community

***We believe that meetups should be about getting to know people.***

Our meetups will always have a facilitated social element, and our promise to you is you will get to know people involved in technology and product/service creation.

### Learning

***We believe that meetups could do more by curating talks.***

Our meetups will always introduce at least one locally present product company, with the speaker talking about the product and technical development joruney.

### Sharing

***We believe in letting the community learn from each other.***

Our meetups will always have an open segment for the community to step up to share with others about their experiences, personal projects, something cool they've been trying *et cetera*.
